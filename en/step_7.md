## What can you do now?

Try the [Paint box](https://projects.raspberrypi.org/en/projects/paint-box?utm_source=pathway&utm_medium=whatnext&utm_campaign=projects) project, where you will create your own painting program!

Or, you can have a look at the [More Scratch Pathway](https://projects.raspberrypi.org/en/pathways/more-scratch), where you will make apps, games and simulations using `message` broadcasting, `if..then` and `if..then..else` decisions and variables.
