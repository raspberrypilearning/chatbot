You can also program your chatbot to change its location.

Add another backdrop to your Stage, for example the 'moon' backdrop.

You can now program your chatbot to ask "Do you want to go to the moon?" and then change location if you answer "yes".

```blocks
ask [Do you want to go to the moon?] and wait
if <(answer) = [yes]> then 
  switch backdrop to [moon v]
end
```

You also need to make sure that your chatbot is in its original location when you start talking to it. Add this block to the top of your chatbot code:

```blocks
when this sprite clicked
switch backdrop to [space v]
```

--- /task ---

--- task ---

Test your program, and answer yes when asked if you want to go to the moon. You should see that the chatbotâ€™s location has changed.

You can also add this code inside your if block, to make your chatbot jump up and down four times if the answer is yes:

if <(answer) = [yes]> then 
  switch backdrop to [moon v]
  repeat (4) 
    change y by (10)
    wait (0.1) secs
    change y by (-10)
    wait (0.1) secs
  end
end
