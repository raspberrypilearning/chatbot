Can you program your chatbot to ask "Do you want to go to the moon", and then change the backdrop when the answer is "yes"?

--- hints ---

--- hint ---

Your chatbot should `ask "Do you want to go to the moon?"`{:class="blocksensing"}, and `if`{:class="blockcontrol"} you `answer`{:class="blocksensing"} "yes", it should `switch the backdrop to the moon`{:class="blocklooks"}.

Here are the code blocks you need to add to your chatbot code.

![nano sprite](images/nano-sprite.png)
```blocks
switch backdrop to [moon v]

ask [Do you want to go to the moon?] and wait

if <(answer) = [yes]> then 

end
```

--- /hint ---

--- hint ---

This is what your code should look like:

```blocks
ask [Do you want to go to the moon?] and wait
if <(answer) = [yes]> then 
  switch backdrop to [moon v]
end
```

Now you need to make sure that your chatbot starts in the right location when you click on it to talk to it. Add this block to the top of your chatbot code:

![nano sprite](images/nano-sprite.png)
```blocks
when this sprite clicked
switch backdrop to [space v]
```

--- /task ---

--- task ---

Test your program, and answer "yes" when the chatbot asks if you want to go to the moon. You should see that the chatbotâ€™s location changes.

You can also add the following code inside the new `if`{:class="blockcontrol"} block to make the chatbot jump up and down four times if you answer "yes":

![nano sprite](images/nano-sprite.png)
```blocks
if <(answer) = [yes]> then 
  switch backdrop to [moon v]
  repeat (4) 
    change y by (10)
    wait (0.1) secs
    change y by (-10)
    wait (0.1) secs
  end
end
```
