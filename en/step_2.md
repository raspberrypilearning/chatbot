+ What is the chatbot's name?
+ Where do they live?
+ Are they happy? Serious? Funny? Shy? Friendly?
+ What do they like and dislike?

The starter project contains four character sprites. One of these will be your chatbot.

You can either use the sprite that is already selected, or choose a different one by right-clicking the one you want and then selecting **show** or **hide** from the menu that appears.
