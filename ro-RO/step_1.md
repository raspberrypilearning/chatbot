## Introduction:

In this project, children will learn how to use 'if' statements to make decisions in their programs.

## Learning Objectives

+ Text input;
+ Decisions: 
    + `if ... then`{:class="blockcontrol"} statements;
    + `if ... then ... else`{:class="blockcontrol"} statements.

This project covers elements from the following strands of the [Raspberry Pi Digital Making Curriculum](http://rpf.io/curriculum):

+ [Use basic programming constructs to create simple programs.](https://www.raspberrypi.org/curriculum/programming/creator)

## Challenges

+ "More questions" - consolidating learning of input and the `answer`{:class="blocksensing"} block;
+ "More decisions" - using decisions;
+ "Make your own chatbot" - consolidation of learning from this and past projects.
