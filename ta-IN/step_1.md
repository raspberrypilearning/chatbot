## Introduction:

In this project, children will learn how to use 'if' statements to make decisions in their programs.

## Resources

For this project, Scratch 2 should be used. Scratch 2 can either be used online at [jumpto.cc/scratch-on](http://jumpto.cc/scratch-on) or can be downloaded from [jumpto.cc/scratch-off](http://jumpto.cc/scratch-off) and used offline.

You can find a completed version of this project [online](http://scratch.mit.edu/projects/26762091/#editor), or it can be downloaded by clicking the 'Project Materials' link for this project, which contains:

+ ChatBot.sb2

## Learning Objectives

+ Text input;
+ Decisions: 
    + `if ... then`{:class="blockcontrol"} statements;
    + `if ... then ... else`{:class="blockcontrol"} statements.

This project covers elements from the following strands of the [Raspberry Pi Digital Making Curriculum](http://rpf.io/curriculum):

+ [Use basic programming constructs to create simple programs.](https://www.raspberrypi.org/curriculum/programming/creator)

## Challenges

+ "More questions" - consolidating learning of input and the `answer`{:class="blocksensing"} block;
+ "More decisions" - using decisions;
+ "Make your own chatbot" - consolidation of learning from this and past projects.
