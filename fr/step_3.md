## Your chatbot

+ Before you start making your chatbot, you need to decide on its personality. **Think about the following questions**:
    
    + What is their name?
    + Where do they live?
    + Are they happy? Serious? Funny? Shy? Friendly?

+ Open a new empty Scratch project.

[[[generic-scratch-new-project]]]

+ Choose one of these character sprites, and add them to your project:

+ Choose a backdrop that fits your chatbot's personality. Here's an example, although yours doesn't have to look like this:
